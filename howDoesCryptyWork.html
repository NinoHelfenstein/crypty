      <h1>How does the Caesar Cipher work?</h1>
      The caesar cipher does work by shifting the char in the alphabet. Crypty
      uses
      <code
        >"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"</code
      >
      to shift.
      <br />
      What this does mean is if you have the Key 1 and the Text
      <code>ABC</code> you are going to get <code>BCD</code>, same with
      <code>AbC</code> is going to be <code>bCd</code>.
      <br />
      It is important to understand that the program checks every character and
      them shifts it by the amount of your key. If the key goes over the length
      of our alphabet it goes to the start again. If the programm recognizes a
      space or line break it is going to skip it and continue with the next
      character. This means every space and line break are going to result in a
      space or line break.

      <h1>How does the Vigenère cipher work?</h1>
      The Vigenère cipher does work by using a Keyword or Phrase as Key. If the Text to Encode is longer than the Key itself we multiply the key until Key & TextToEncode have the same length and convert it both to uppercase. Then each letter of the plaintext is shifted based on the corresponding letter in the Keyword. Crypty
      uses
      <code
        >"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"</code
      >
      to shift.
      <br />
      What this does mean is if you have the Key "Key" and the plaintext
      <code>Hello</code>. You are going to multiply the Key until it has the same length as <code>Hello</code> so the final Key will be "KEYKE". Now we shift each letter of the plaintext base on the corresponding letter in the Keyword/phrase. For the first Letter that would be "H" shifted with letter "K" (=10) the second would be "E" shifted with the keyletter "E" and so on.
      so <code>Hello</code> is going to be <code>RIJVS</code>.
      <br />
      It is important to understand that the program only loops over the Letters A-Za-z.
      If you use a Number inside the TextToEncode, it will always display the real number 
      and not shift over it. Because we shift each letter in the plaintext with a new 
      value as from the Key, there isn't a good chance to find out the Key. But if we 
      use the same Key more than once, somebody might be able to find it out and use it 
      for illegal purposes so always make new Keys. If there are Spaces in the plaintext, those wont be shifted, so there will be no spaces in the Decode Output.
