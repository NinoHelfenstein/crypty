      <h1>How does the Caesar cipher work?</h1>
      The caesar cipher does work by shifting the char in the alphabet. Crypty
      uses
      <code
        >"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"</code
      >
      to shift.
      <br />
      What this does mean is if you have the Key 1 and the Text
      <code>ABC</code> you are going to get <code>BCD</code>, same with
      <code>AbC</code> is going to be <code>bCd</code>.
      <br />
      It is important to understand that the program checks every character and
      them shifts it by the amount of your key. If the key goes over the length
      of our alphabet it goes to the start again. If the programm recognizes a
      space or line break it is going to skip it and continue with the next
      character. This means every space and line break are going to result in a
      space or line break.

      <h1>How does the Vigenère cipher work?</h1>
      The Vigenère cipher does work by using a Keyword or Phrase as Key. If the Text to Encode is longer than the Key itself we multiply the key until Key & TextToEncode have the same length and convert it both to uppercase. Then each letter of the plaintext is shifted based on the corresponding letter in the Keyword. Crypty
      uses
      <code
        >"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"</code
      >
      to shift.
      <br />
      What this does mean is if you have the Key "Key" and the plaintext
      <code>Hello</code>. You are going to multiply the Key until it has the same length as <code>Hello</code> so the final Key will be "KEYKE". Now we shift each letter of the plaintext base on the corresponding letter in the Keyword/phrase. For the first Letter that would be "H" shifted with letter "K" (=10) the second would be "E" shifted with the keyletter "E" and so on.
      so <code>Hello</code> is going to be <code>RIJVS</code>.
      <br />
      It is important to understand that the program only loops over the Letters A-Za-z.
      If you use a Number inside the TextToEncode, it will always display the real number 
      and not shift over it. Because we shift each letter in the plaintext with a new 
      value as from the Key, there isn't a good chance to find out the Key. But if we 
      use the same Key more than once, somebody might be able to find it out and use it 
      for illegal purposes so always make new Keys. If there are Spaces in the plaintext, those wont be shifted, so there will be no spaces in the Decode Output.


    
      <h1>How does the Playfair cipher work?</h1>
      The Playfair cipher does work by using a Keyword or Phrase as Key and a Textinput. Crypty
      uses
      <code
        >"ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"</code
      >
      to shift.
      <br />
      What this does mean is if you have the "Key" and the "plaintext" you can start by making a 5x5 table, in which we add our Key in the first row(if the key is longer than 5, it goes to the second line of the table). Each letter is for one field in the table and there are no duplicates allowed. after we inserted the key, we start adding the other letters(from the alphabet) that are missing. Only the letter "J" is excepted (because I = J in Playfair). now we use the plaintext we want to encrypt.
      first we split the plaintext in pairs of 2 letters. if there are doubleletters we separate them  with an X. Z.B. "Hello" would be "He lx lo". If the number of letters in the plaintext is odd, we have to add an X at the last position, because we need a even number of letters for the pairs. then we have to use the rules to create the encrypted letterpairs from the plaintext.
      <br><strong>Rule 1:</strong> If both letters from the pair are on the same row, the text shifts right. if one of the letters is at the right table border, we remove the letter from the right side and add it on the left side in the same row.
      <br><strong>Rule 2:</strong> If both letters from the pair create a square(always 2 sides have to be even) the letters move inside the square from the side it was to the other side on the same row.
      <br><strong>Rule 3:</strong> If both letters from the pair are on the same column, the letter shift down. if one letter reached the bottom it would shift to the top of the same column<br>
      with the Key "World" our Plaintext <code>Hello</code> would encrypt to <code>KBRYDR</code>, which decrypts to <code>He lx lo</code>. Or a even worse example if we use Flexbox as plaintext because encrypted it woul look like <code>EDCYHBYY</code> which gets decrypted to <code>Fl ex bo xV SV</code> without my small fixes in Javascript code. with my fixes in javascript it displays <code>Flexbox</code> as normal word.<br />
      It is important to understand that the program only uses strings with the Letters A-Z(except J).
      Because the Playfair Method has some special Problems, i mad an extra Code which will try to remove the Xs from doubleletters and endings. While i tried the Playfair cipher, i also saw that there are some similar Problems with "E", "W" & "V". so i added extra code to remove them too.
      Also i added errorMessages for Problems with numbers and special chars, so there shouldn't be many problems.
